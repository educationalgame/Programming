Variables are like containers store data,
they have a name to them like boxes
in our home which have something in it
and we keep a label on it.
"""

# SubTopic: Data types of Variables
"""
There are types of variables depend upon the data they store,
like in our home we keep food in one box
and oils in another box. These are called as data types.
There are six data types.
They are:
    1. None
    
    2. Numeric:
        1. Integer
        2. Float
        3. Complex

Typecasting is like conversion of centimeters to meters.
In variables typecasting is about converting from one data type to another.
This is done by it's corresponding functions like str, int etc.
"""

# SubTopic: Swapping Variables
"""
We can swap variables in programming
but it is a bit difficult in other programming
languages in python it is easy to swap variables.
"""

# SubTopic: Idâ€™s of Variables
"""
In variables the data should be stored.
When the data is stored in computer
it should be identified by the computer 
so every variable has a id different then it's name.
"""

# SubTopic: Rules of Variables
"""
When declaring variables there are some rules to follow.
They are:
    1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
    2. A variable name cannot start with a number.
    3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
    4. Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are three different variables).
    5. The keywords (A reserved word that can be understood by a programming language)
       cannot be used naming the variable.
"""

Raw strings are also a special type of string used to show raw format of a string like
if we keep a special character in between a string then to skip it we use raw strings.
"""

# SubTopic: Single, Double, Triple quotes
"""
Single quotes are widely because of comfort. These is mostly used by programmers.
Double quotes are used when there is a single quote in between a string but we can also use it in case of single quotes.
Triple quotes are for writing doc strings or if there is single and double quotes in a string.
"""

# Topic: Inputs
"""
When we need to interact with a user we take inputs.
Inputs are values given or taken by a user.

When dealing operators we can get errors in code.
Many errors come because we might perform operations on different
data types like a number with a string.
"""

# Topic: Decision Control Flow
"""
Decision Control flow means that controlling the flow or deciding of execution of a program.
To control the flow in python we use if, elif, else keywords or blocks.
In python we call them as Suite. We also to follow some rules when the code.
In programming languages it is called as Syntax.
"""

# SubTopic: If
"""
if is a keyword used for determining whether a condition is true or false.
If the condition is true then only it shall execute the following statements.

else is another keyword which tells python to try this condition
if the previous condition was false.
"""

# SubTopic: If, Elif, Else
"""
elif is also another keyword which tells python to try this condition
if the previous if condition is false.
We can use as many as if's, elif's or else we want but they should follow a order of if, elif, else.

# SubTopic: Nested If Statements
"""
When we have if, elif, else inside if or elif or else than these are called as nested statements.
We can use them randomly with following the order.
We can also be make infinite nested statements.
We can also make infinite if, elif, else

# Topic: Repetition Control Flow
"""
When want to perform a task repeatedly then we use loops.
These is called as repetition control flow.
There are two types of loops.
They are:
    1. for loop
    2. while loop

"""
for loop is for iterating (repeating a operation) a sequence like a string etc.
With for loop we can execute many operations for each value in a sequence.

We can use for, else together in python in some scenarios like iterating a sequence to check a condition
and if it is not true then do another operation only once.
"""

# SubTopic: while Loop
"""
while loop will execute a block of statements repeatedly until the condition is true.
If the condition becomes false it will stop.

"""
break, continue, pass are keywords used mainly in loops.
1. break means stop the loop.
2. continue means leave this iteration and go to the next iteration.
3. pass means there are no statements here, skip it. pass can also be used with if, elif, else statements.
"""

# Topic: Python collections
"""
Collections are a set of values which can be stored at once.
These are also called as container types.
There are four types of collections.
They are:
    1. List ( [] )
    2. Tuple ( () )
    3. Set ( {} )
    4. Dictionary ( { : } )

# SubTopic: List
"""
List is a collection of values written inside square brackets ( [] ) separated by commas ( , ).
It can store duplicate values.
It can store different data types like string, bool etc.
It can also store any python collections including list.
It is mutable (After making it we can change it).
It is iterable.
"""

# SubTopic: Functions of List
"""
There are many functions of list like append, pop etc.
These functions can only used on lists and some of them can be used on any data types.
"""

# SubTopic: List Comprehension
"""
When we need to iterate a list
we will make a list or take input
and make a for or while loop and add if statements
but we have a elegant way to do this.
We can make a for or while loop with if statements inside a list.
This is called as list comprehension.
"""

# SubTopic: Tuple
"""
Tuple is also a collection of values written inside parenthesis ( () ) separated by commas ( , )
but unlike lists tuple is immutable (After making it we cannot change it)
because of immutability there is no tuple comprehension.
In other ways tuple is quite similar to list.
"""

# SubTopic: Functions of Tuple
"""
There are many functions of tuple.
Because tuple is immutable there fewer functions like append
compared to other data types.
"""

# SubTopic: Set
"""
Set is a collection of values written inside curly brackets ( {} ) separated by commas ( , )
but unlike lists set only stores unique values and it is unordered
because it is unordered we cannot access items using indexes in it.
We use sets in some scenarios instead of list because set is highly optimized method
for checking whether a specific element is present.
"""

# SubTopic: Functions of Set
"""
There are many functions in set.
Because set is unordered there fewer functions like index
compared to other data types.
"""

# SubTopic: Set Comprehension
"""
Like list comprehensions we also have set comprehensions
but result would be unordered because it is a set.
"""

# SubTopic: Dictionary
"""
Dictionary is a collection of values written inside square brackets ( {} )
in a key, value pair separated by comma ( , ).
Key and Value are separated by colan ( : ).
It holds a pair of values,
one being the key (These are case sensitive)
and the other corresponding pair element being its value.
Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated,
whereas keys canâ€™t be repeated and must be immutable.
It is also called as mapping type because we map values to keys.
It is like a mixture of set and list with key, value pair
"""

# SubTopic: Functions of Dictionary
"""
There are many functions in dictionary.
Because dictionary is mapping type there few extra functions like keys
compared to other data types.
"""

# SubTopic: Dictionary Comprehension
"""
Like set comprehension we also have dictionary comprehension
but it is quite different then set comprehension because of key, value pair.
"""

# SubTopic: Typecasting in Collections
""" 
We can change a collection to another collection
by it's corresponding functions like list, dict.
We can also make a collection without using
it's specified brackets by using it's corresponding
keyword like list, dict etc.
"""

# Topic: Functions
"""
Let us see what functions are exactly are.
Functions are set of statements to achieve a specific task like adding numbers etc.
We use functions because it is reusable instead of writing or copy pasting the code.
In python we have so many in-built functions like print, input etc.
They are like helpers.
Functions have two steps.
They are:
    1. Defining a function
    2. Calling a function
"""

# SubTopic: Types of Functions
"""
There are two types of functions.
They are:
    1. Built-in functions
    2. User-defined functions
"""

# SubTopic: Parameters (Arguments)
"""
Parameter are special kind of variable passed to a function to
perform a specific task on those variables.
When the input is given to a function it is called as a argument.
There are different types of parameters.
"""

# SubTopic: Pass by value or reference
"""
Pass by value means we are passing the value of the variable
not the variable itself so it would use a different memory location.
Pass by reference means we are passing the address or memory location of the variable
by these the variable will changed inside and outside the function.
In python we have a different concept that
if we access the variable then the memory location would be same
but when we change the value inside the function it will take another memory location
so it would not affect the outside variable because the value is immutable
if the value is mutable it will change the variable outside the function also.
"""

# SubTopic: Types of Parameters
"""
There are four types of parameters.
They are:
    1. Positional
    2. Keyword
    3. Default
    4. *args and **kwargs
    
Normally if we make a function then all the parameters should be specified
but we can make parameters optional or not compulsory by many ways.
These are called as optional parameters.
"""

# SubTopic: Scope of Variables
"""
Normally we make variables inside a function and also outside a function.
This is were Scope comes into play
if we make the same variables inside and outside a function 
so then the outside one is called as a global variable which can accessed from anywhere in a file
the inside one is called as local variable which can be accessed only inside that particular function.
To use a global variable inside a function we use the keyword called as global.
"""

# SubTopic: Lambda Functions
"""
Lambda functions are anonymous functions which means they have no name to them.
Normally when we make functions we should call them after making them
but in lambdas they can be used anywhere.
These are defined in one line so it is also called as one-liner functions.
"""

# SubTopic: map, filter, reduce
"""
map, filter, reduce are some methods will can be used with lambdas and without it.
These are methods used very commonly in programs.
"""

# SubTopic: Recursion
"""
Recursion is about calling the function inside the function.
We can also call different functions inside a function.
Recursion is used in many scenarios.
In some scenarios it makes more sense to use recursion over iteration.
"""

# SubTopic: Decorator
"""
Decorator is a tool used to modify a function with help of another function
without permanently changing the original function.
It is simply another function which can wrapped on any function
to extend it's behaviour (The task a function does).
We can achieve decorators in few ways.
"""

# SubTopic: Generators
"""
Generators are functions with yield keyword instead of return keyword.
yield is used to generate a value at a time.
It is used in some scenarios like handling large datasets where we will work only on a single dataset

"""
There are two types of modules.
They are:
1. Built-in modules
2. Created modules
"""

# SubTopic: Created modules
"""
Created modules are modules which we create by ourself.
Any python file is called a module.
Mostly modules have code which should imported

Pip stands for pip install package.
It is a package manager which is bundled with python.
It is used for installing third-party modules or packages
created by other developers which help us for various purposes.

# SubTopic: Module installation
"""
To install a module:
1. We open the terminal or powershell
2. Type the command pip install <package name>

# SubTopic: Virtual Environment (venv)
"""
Virtual Environment is a like a isolated folder or project which has a separate python
than the system-wide python by this we can install packages for only the separate python.
When we have multiple projects with different sets of dependencies or requirements
we can make different Virtual Environments for different projects.
"""

# SubTopic: What modules contain?
"""
Modules contain different sets of statements like functions and variables etc.
They are made in mind that these would be imported to other files so usually they don't runnable code.
"""

# SubTopic: Module v/s Script
"""
Module is a python file which is usually imported to other files.
Script is a runnable code like adding two numbers etc.
But modules can also have runnable code.
"""

# SubTopic: Special variable __name__
"""
A special variable __name__ is to determine
whether a module is the main module or not.
"""

# Topic: Math Module
"""
Math module is used for doing advanced calculations
which are not built-in to python directly like sqrt,factorial etc.
"""

# Topic: Array
"""
Array is also a python collection like list,set and tuple etc.
But it is a bit more complex than others.
"""

# Note: Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead.
#  However, to work with arrays in Python you will have to import a library, like the NumPy library.

# SubTopic: Functions of array

With numpy we can make a multi-dimensional array
most likely a two-dimensional array.
Two-Dimensional Array consists of various rows and columns like a matrix.
"""

# Topic: Exception or Error handling
"""
Errors are the problems in a program
due to which the program will stop the execution.
So exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically correct
but the code resulted in an error.
This exception does not stop the execution of the program,
however, it changes the flow of the program.
"""

# SubTopic: Types of errors
"""
There are three types of errors.
They are:
1. Syntax Errors
2. Logical Errors
3. Runtime Errors

Syntax Errors are done by the developer with syntax.
Logical Errors are which have problem with the logic.
Runtime Errors are which user make so as a developer
we need to handle those errors.
We can to it in python by using try, except keywords.
"""

# SubTopic: try, except, finally
"""
try is a keyword which is used before the
problematic or questionable statements in logic and runtime.
except keyword is used to manipulate the error.
finally is used to complete the error like closing a file.

# SubTopic: Raising exceptions
"""
Sometimes we know a error can occur so we raise exceptions to handle it
in such a way that user could understand like popping a message etc.
"""

# Topic: File I/O
"""
In python we can play with files like .txt, .pdf files etc.
We can edit and read files.
First we need to open a file, play with it and close the file.
There are four types of modes to open a file.
They are:
1. "r" for reading.
2. "w"  for writing.
3.  a"  for appending.
4. "r+"  for both reading and writing
We can also create files.
"""

# SubTopic: Directories
"""
Directories are important because
when you create a file it will be created in the working directory.
When you try to open a file it will search in the working directory
until we specify the file path.
We can also create in different directories.

# SubTopic: open keyword
"""
open keyword is used to open a file.
It is mandatory to open the file before you work with it.
"""

# SubTopic: open, close
"""
After you open the file and work with it,
it is a good practice to close the file.
To close a file we use the close keyword.
"""

# SubTopic: Context Managers
"""
Context managers will manage the usage of a resource like open and closing file
regardless of a error in code logically and in runtime.
A example of this is with keyword.
We can also create our own context managers with the module named contextlib.
"""

# SubTopic: with Keyword
"""
With the help of with suite (A group of individual statements which make a code block like if, for, while
and also with keywords. All suites require indentation. Suite is also called as block)
we no longer need to close the file because with block will close it by itself.
It is a good practice to use with suite to work with files.
