HTML is a Markup language.

1. Markup languages:
	This are languages to structure the data and 
	enter the static (Constant) data into the page (Webpage)
	to structure the data we use tags

In html code can be directly executed by browser.

In html we have a basic structure to code.

2. Structure of code:
	<!DOCTYPE html>  # this tells browser that this is a html file
	<html> # to tell it's html code
		<head> # this is a head for webpage
			<title></title> # the title that we see on tab
		</head> # closing tag of head
		<body> # this is what we see in page like it's a body (Most code is written here)

		</body> # closing tag of body
	</html> # closing tag for html 

In above code we saw tags (Keywords)
tags are something html only understands it only sees 
the content inside tags.

Tags can be written in angular brackets (<>)
Tags are also specific and predefined.
 
They are not case sensitive(Means can be capital or small letters).
Tags have opening and ending part.
They are known has opening and closing tags in html.
We can close tags by adding "/"to the tag name before
Exceptionally we have only one part of tag.

They are known as self closing tags.
We write as <tagname/>.

Many tags have attributes (Arguments).
Which bring css with them or not.

Tags inside tags are known as nested tags (We use this everywhere in code).

There are different kinds of tags for different purposes
like for commenting (Notes for humans to read) is <!--write here-->.

To represent something not included in character set (All symbols) of keyboard.
We use character codes in html.

3. Essential Html Tags :
    1. html tag:
        All tags fall in between the html tags.
        It defines the document as Web page.

    2. head tag:
        The header contains information like title
        of the document that won't appear on actual page.

    3. title tag
        The title defines the title that will
        appear in the title bar of the Web browser.

    4. body tag
        The body tags contain all the visible
        content of the page including all images, links, etc.

    1.Basic Tags:
        1. Headings and Subheadings:

            <h1> A heading </h1>

            There are 6 levels of headings
            available from smallest to largest. ( h1 to h6)

        2. Paragraphs:

            <p> Some text  </p>

        3. Links:

            <a href = "URL" </a>

        4. Image:

            <img src = "photo.jpg">

    2.Tag Attributes:
        Attributes helps one to customise a tag and are defined within the opening tag.
        For Example - <ol type = "a"> (ol stands for Ordered list and ul for Unordered List)
        Attributes are often assigned a value using the equal sign, such as width = 65%

        1. Break Tag:
            <br> Tag is used for styling. In most cases it's preferred to use CSS and Javascript for Styling.

        2. Comment Tag: It's not visible on the actual page but remains saved in the language itself.

            <!--- this is a comment --->

        3. Form tag: It is used for adding a special Form to the Web page.

            <form>

            Enter your name : <input type = 'text'/>

            <form>

    Similarly there are also other tags like <table> tags used to form a table with table row and table headings.
    Caption tags, Div Tags, Meta tags, etc.
