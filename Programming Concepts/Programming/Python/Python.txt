1. Execution of python:
	Python is an interpreter, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
	It is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.
	Python is an interpreted language and not a compiled one,
 	Although compilation is a step.
 	Python code, written in .py file is first compiled
 	to what is called byte code which is stored with a .pyc or .pyo format.

	1. Advantages of Interpreted Languages:
		One popular advantage of interpreted languages is that they are platform-independent.
		As long as the Python byte code and the Virtual Machine have the same version
		Python byte code can be executed on any platform (Windows, Macs, etc).

	2. Dynamic Typing:
		Dynamic typing is another advantage. 
		In static-typed languages like C++, you have to declare the variable type
		and any discrepancy like adding a string and an integer is checked during compile time.
		In strongly typed languages like Python, it is the job of the interpreter to 
		check the validity of the variable types and operations performed.
		Dynamic typing provides a lot of freedom, 
		But simultaneously it makes your code risky and sometimes difficult to debug.
		Python is often accused of being ‘slow’
		Now while the term is relative and argued a lot,
		The reason for being slow is because the interpreter
		Has to do extra work to have the byte code instruction 
		Translated into a form that can be executed on the machine.

	3. Garbage Collector:
		In older programming languages, memory allocation was quite manual.
		Many times when you use variables that are no longer in use or referenced
		Anywhere else in the program, they need to be cleaned from the memory.
		Garbage Collector does that for you.
		It automatically frees up space without you doing anything.
		The memory management works in two ways —
		In a simplified way, it keeps track of the number of references to an object.
		When that number goes down to zero, it deletes that object.
		This is called reference counting. This cannot be disabled in Python.
		In cases where object references itself or two objects refer each other,
		a process called generation garbage collection helps.
		This is something traditional reference counting cannot take care of.

	4. Pycache Folder:
		As you can see, the filename is the same as the one outside __pycache__ folder.
		The .pyc extension tells us that the file contains byte code for preprocess.py.
		The names cpython denotes the type of interpreter.
		CPython means that the interpreter was implemented in C language.
		Similarly, JPython is a Python interpreter implemented in Java.
		Well, it slightly increases the speed of the Python program.
		Unless you change your Python code,
		Recompilation to byte code is avoided, thereby saving time.

2. Python Commands:
	To use python interpreter in powershell == python (or) py
	To check the version of python == python --version (or) py --version


	To check pip commands == pip
	To check pip version == pip --version
	To install a python package == pip install <package name>
	To upgrade pip == python -m pip install --upgrade pip
	To upgrade all python packages == pip freeze | %{$_.split('==')[0]} | %{pip install --upgrade $_}

3. To make a Package:
	1. Make a Python Package
	2. Python setup.py bdist_wheel (Execute this command in powershell/terminal)

	Note: The Directory should in setup.py

4. To make a exe file to a Python file:
	1. pip install pyinstaller (Execute this command in powershell/terminal)
	2. Change directory to that python file you want to execute
	3. pyinstaller --onefile -w <The python file name>

	Note: -w is for not having the console when executing it
     	     --onefile is for having only one file

5. To see Documentation of Python Locally:
	1. Open idle
	2. Type help()
	   and write what you want to know
	   or If we know topic type help("topic")
